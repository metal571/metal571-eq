# metal571 LCD-2F rev 2016+
#
# NOTES:
# This is based loosely on the Reveal+ preset, but with more upper mids and 
# instead of adding 9k in between, we kill 6k and 11k peaks by ear instead.
# Adjust Filter 1 to taste, to a maximum of 5.5 dB (Harman OE target). If 
# you want to go higher, you'll have to adjust the preamp, i.e. Filter 1 
# 6 dB, then preamp -6 dB. Preamp needs to attentuate by at least 5.5 dB 
# though in order to avoid compression due to the upper midrange boost
# this headphone needs in order to sound normal.
