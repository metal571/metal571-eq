# metal571 Audeze LCD-2F rev 2016+
# Late (November) 2020+ non-memory-foam pads
#
# NOTES:
# This profile is for genuine leather non-memory-foam pads and 2016 revision. If
# your pads are memory foam (slow rebound) use the older "2018" profile.
#
# Adjust Filter 1 to taste. If you want to go higher, you'll have to adjust the
# preamp, i.e. Filter 1 6 dB, then preamp -6 dB. Depending on your ear's
# anatomy, Filters 5 and 6 may not be the correct center frequencies. Adjust as
# needed, using what you hear when sweeping using a tool such as
# https://www.szynalski.com/tone-generator/, but most importantly, music itself.
