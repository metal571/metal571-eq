# metal571 Koss Porta Pro
#
# NOTES:
# This one is tuned specifically for the Porta Pro mounted to the Parts Express
# Mini Stereo Lightweight Headphones (Part # 240-015) with Yaxi (yaxi.jp)
# earpads, which in my experience so far is the optimal Porta Pro setup. Bass
# and low mids filters are directly borrowed from oratory1990, but by ear I
# think this still needs some 2k killed. I simplified and tuned my own filter at
# 5.5k by ear as well to kill the pesky low treble/sibilance region on these.
