# metal571 Sennheiser HD 800
#
# NOTES:
# This uses oratory1990 settings in the bass. For some reason despite the full
# Harman OE shelf on this profile, it doesn't sound overbearing to me this
# time. This thing is still just as bright as it's always been, and
# unbelievably capable of handling bass boosts despite being an open dynamic.
