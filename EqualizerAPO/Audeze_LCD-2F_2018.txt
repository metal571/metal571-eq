# metal571 Audeze LCD-2F rev 2016+
# Memory foam pads (at least as far back as 2018)
#
# NOTES:
# This profile is for genuine leather memory foam pads and 2016 revision. If
# your pads are not memory foam (immediate rebound) and your LCD-2 was purchased
# from Nov. 2020 onwards, use the new "2021" profile.
#
# This is based loosely on the Reveal+ preset, but with more upper mids and
# instead of adding 9k in between, we kill 6k and 11k peaks by ear instead.
# Someone please let me know if they see this because yes I know this can be
# pretty dark for "serious audiophile music". Adjust Filter 1 to taste, to a
# maximum of 5 dB (Harman OE target is 5.5). If you want to go higher, you'll
# have to adjust the preamp, i.e. Filter 1 6 dB, then preamp -6 dB. Preamp must
# attentuate by at least 5 dB though in order to avoid compression/clipping due
# to the upper midrange boost this headphone needs in order to sound normal.
