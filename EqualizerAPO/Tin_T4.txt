# metal571 Tin HiFi T4
#
# NOTES:
# Yeah, I don't know if it's Tin Audio or Tin HiFi anymore, so we'll just leave
# that file name alone. Maybe crin should make a PR against my repo to fix that,
# LOL. Anyway, this one is real simple, but VERY annoying to listen to on some
# genres without this sibilance killer preset. I'm using the stock medium
# silicones.
