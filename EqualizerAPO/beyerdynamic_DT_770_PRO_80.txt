# metal571 beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO 80 Ohm
#
# NOTES:
# This one was a bit unexpected. Once the sibilance is removed by ear using my
# trusty https://www.szynalski.com/tone-generator/, the upper mids were just
# shouting my ear off, which ended up being 2.5k. Comparing that to oratory's
# and Rtings' graphs, I guess that makes some sense. DT 770 never had a
# reputation for having forward mids at all, but maybe the 80 ohm is a weird
# one. Don't know, but this is what my ears told me to do. Also I've left it up
# to you if you want to lower the truly giant bass shelf by adding a 105 Hz LS
# filter and cutting dBs from there. But for me, some of the fun of owning this
# thing is the massive sub bass, so I'll leave it like this for now. Oh, and
# make sure your OEM EDT770V pads are absolutely brand new, or this won't
# sound right.
