# metal571 Sennheiser HD 650
#
# NOTES:
# This is a hybrid between the oratory1990 setting in the bass, 
# just with less boost, and my own upper midrange settings by ear.
# You can set Filter 2 to taste, but you have to decrease the preamp
# to compensate. i.e. Filter 2 7.5 dB will require preamp to be -10 dB.
# If you go too far on this filter, you will cause some annoying 
# harmonic distortion since this is an old school open dynamic design,
# and not a sealed front volume open back planar magnetic.
